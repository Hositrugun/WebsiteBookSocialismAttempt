<center><h2><a id="Preface">Preface:</a></h2></center>
  <p>Several reviewers objected to the arrangement of the first volume of this work, because they held that it should have been grouped round the ideas or general movements of thought rather than round the attitudes and projects of particular thinkers. Such reviewers will probably prefer this second volume, which comes nearer to the arrangement they favoured. I cannot, however, say that they converted me; for this second volume was completely planned and largely written before the reviews of the first volume appeared. It was, in my opinion, necessary, in dealing with the period up to 1848, to group the account of developments in Socialist thought round individual thinkers and the movements they inspired; for in effect there was, in the first half of the nineteenth century, no such thing as a Socialist movement possessing a unity and a central point of focus. Such a movement came into being only after 1848, and to a great extent after 1860, with the International Working Men's Association and the struggles within it between the rival tendencies I have described in the present volume. These struggles were indeed the birth-pangs of Socialism as an international force acting upon the working classes of all the economically advanced countries. The contest between Marxists and Anarchists - which was in fact a confused conflict of many rival tendencies - occupied a key position in the development of Socialism as a movement; and at the same time the struggle in Germany between Lassallians and Eisenachers, though the points at issue were essentially different, gave to the Marxists, after the destruction of French Socialism in the Paris Commune, a commanding lead in the creation of the new Socialist movements of the 1880s. The record of these events, and of the thought which influenced them, lends itself to a much more coherent account than was possible in dealing with the welter of theories and movements that confronts the student of Socialism up to 1848.</p>
<p>Of course, the main reason for the difference is that, in its revival in the 1860s, Socialism became for the first time decisively a working-class movement resting on the support of a large proletariat of industrial wage-earners in factories, mines, railways, and other relatively large-scale employments. Theorists no longer made theories in a vacuum, or in relation to a mainly unorganised mass of victims of oppression. They had to take increasing account of Trade Unions as established bodies, and of political parties to which the enlargement of electorates gave an impetus towards parliamentary activities and away from mass revolts or revolutionary plottings. They had to turn more of their attention to the problems of bringing large-scale industry under social control and to the uses to be made of parliamentary action either as a new means of propaganda or for the winning of reforms within the structure of capitalist society. This question, of reform <i>versus</i> revolution, was not fully fought out until a later period; and the main account of it will be given only in my third volume. But it had already presented itself, by the 1860s, in both Great Britain and the United States, as well as in Switzerland, though hardly in France or Belgium, or in Germany, barely in Italy, and not at all in Spain. Marxism, as well as the various brands of Anarchism, Anarchist-Communism, and Federalism, still presented itself mainly as a revolutionary force, in hostility to the various kinds of reformism, from Christian Social movements to <i>bourgeois</i>-led Radicalism and 'Liberal-Labourism'. But it was significant that, in the First International, Marxists no longer formed the extreme left. </p>
<p>I have again been hampered in writing this volume by my linguistic limitations - by knowing no Russian, very little German, and practically no Spanish or Italian. This means that I tend to rely as much as possible on sources in English or French, including translations, and that my Russian and Spanish information, in particular, comes largely at second hand. My third volume, which will cover the period, approximately, from the birth of the Second International in 1889 to the Russian Revolution of 1917, is already fully planned, and partly drafted. I hope to round off the work in a final volume, and then, possibly, to go back and deal with the antecedents of Socialism in the period before 1789.</p>
<p> My obligations for help with this second volume are great. Mr. Isaiah Berlin has again aided me generously, especially in relation to Russia; and I have profited very much from the criticism and advice of Mr. H.N. Brailsford and of Mr. Morris Pearl, who both read the whole volume in typescript and gave me most valuable suggestions for improving it. Mr. John Plamenatz was kind enough to read three chapters - VI-VIII - and made useful suggestions. Mr. Arthur Lehning and Dr. Rüter, of the International Institute for Social History, both helped me with book references for the Belgian chapter. Mr. H.M. Pelling kindly lent me the proofs of his book, <i>The Origins of the Labour Party</i>, which has since been published. I have again to thank my brother-in-law, Raymond Postgate, and Mr. H. L. Beales for lending me books from their collections, and in addition to these Mr. Pearl and Mr. James Joll. My secretary, Rosamund Broadley, has again coped nobly with a mass of difficulties. </p>
