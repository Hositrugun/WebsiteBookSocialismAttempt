<h2 class="CentreHeading">Preface:</h2>
	<p class="JustifyParagraph">
		This book, althought it stands by itself, is designed to be the first of a series forming together a general history of Socialist thought. It covers, roughly, the years from 1789 to the middle of the nineteenth century; but even the limits of space which I have set myself, it obviously leaves out some things which belong to that period. The biggest of these omissions is that of Russian Socialism - from Pestel's projects of land nationalisation in the 1820s to Belinsky, Herzen, and Bakunin, who were all active well before 1850. This omission is deliberate, and will be made good in the second volume. I found it more convenient to postpone discussion of Herzen and Bakunin with the struggles which split the First International and with the development of Anarchism. As against these omissions, I have carried the story of a number of thinkers with whom I have dealt in the present volume a long way beyond 1850. Blanqui and Proudhon are outstanding instances. In the case of Marx and Engels, on the other hand, I have tried to deal only with the earlier phases, leaving the later development of their thought to be discussed in connection with the movements which they created or influenced in the second half of the century. Thus, no full exposition of Marxism is attempted in this volume, which stops short, not quite at the <i>Communism Manifesto</i>,  but at the dissolution of the Communist League after the eclipse of the European revolutionary movement at the beinning of the 1850s.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		I wish to make it clear that this book is not meant to be a history of a Socialism, but only of Socialist <i>thought</i> with such references to actual movements as are necessary to explain the thought. Indeed, the writing of a comprehensive history of Socialism would be an impossible task for any single author, and would have to be on a much bigger scale than anything I have in mind to write - or should have, even if I possessed the requisite knowledge. Even within the more modest limits of what I am attempting I am very conscious of my short-comings. I have no Russian, almost no Spanish, very little Italian, and not much German; and I hate reading German, and avoid it whenever I can. I tend therefore to use English or French translations of works in these languages where they exist, and to refer to German originals of translated works only when I want to be sure a passage has not been wrongly rendered. I also tend to take my German material much more at second hand, where translations do not exist, than either English or French writings; and I expect my more expert readers will easily discover this for themselves, though I hope I have not allowed myself to be led badly astray.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		The second volume of this work is already half in draft. Besides picking up the omitted Russian pioneers, it deals mainly with the later phases of Marxism up to the rise of the various Social Democratic Parties in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, with the First International, the Paris Commune, and the split between Marxists, Anarchists, and those, such as the British Fabians and Independent Labourites, who were neither, and also with the continenetal developments of Christian Social doctrine after 1850 and with the peculiarly German movement often called 'Academic Socialism', or 'Socialism of the Chair'. I mention these facts because they help to explain the omission from the present volume of a number of non-Russian Socialists who had begun to be active well before 1850 - for example, Rodbertus, Lassalle, and von Kettler in Germany, Colins, Kats, and de Kayser in Belgium, and some of the Italian and Spanish pioneers.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		In connection with the present volume, I have a number of obligations to acknowledge. The greatest of all is to my colleage, Isaiah Berlin, who has read the whole book in proof and has helped me to improve it greatly in accordance with his admirably sagacious criticisms. I also owe valuable suggestions to my colleagues, Dr. H.G. Schenk and John Plamenatz, who read a number of chapters and put me right in not a few places where I had gone wrong. I am also most grateful to my brother-in-law, Raymond Postgate, and to my friend, H.L. Beales, for the loan of books which I should have not found it easy to obtain elsewhere; and, as always, I owe a great deal to the untiring help of my secretary, Rosamund Broadley, who, by a miracle, can read my writing and forgive me for it. <br> My wife I am in debt to so often that I usually end by not thanking her at all.<br> G.D.H.

	<p class="JustifyParagraph">
		The impossibility of defining Socialism has often been emphasised, and sometimes regarded as a reproach. But neither in Politics nor in Morals is any important idea or system ever capable of being exactly defined. Who can satisfactorily define democracy, or liberty, or virtue, or happiness, or the State, or for that matter, individualism any more than Socialism? The most that can be attempted in such cases as these, with any prospect of success, is the discovery of some central core of meaning, present with varying additions in all or most of the manifold uses of the words in question, but in all probability never found alone, without any addition. The discovery of this central core will not enable us to understand these words; for the added significances form no less essential parts of their acquired meanings. A word means what it is used to mean, or, for practical purposes, at what it is commonly used to mean, or has been commonly used to mean by persons to whose utterances we need to pay any attention. Nevertheless, if we can find a central core of meaning, we are better placed for understanding the varieties of usage; and in the search for this core it is a valuable first step to find out how a word first came into use. 
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		It is not known who first used the words 'Socialism' and 'socialist'. So far as is known, they first appeared in print in Italian in 1803, but in a sense entirely unconnected with any of their later meanings. Thereafter there has, so far, been found no trace of them until 1827, when the word 'socialist' was used in the owenite <i>Co-operative Magazine</i> to designate the followers of Owen's Co-operative doctrines. The word '<i>socialisme</i>' made its first known appearance in print in a French periodical - <i>Le Globe</i> - in 1832. This paper was then edited by Pierre Leroux, who had made it the principal organ of the Saint-Simonians; and the word '<i>socialisme</i>' was used as a characterisation of the Saint-Simonian doctrine. The word was freely used by Leroux and Reynaud during the 1830s in their <i>Nouvelle Encyclop√©die</i> and in other writings, and soon came to be employed in a wider sense to include a number of groups aiming at some kind of new social order resting on an economic and social conception of human rights. Thereafter, both 'Socialism', and 'socialist' were used quite frequently both in France and in Great Britain; and they soon spread to Germany and to other European countries and also to the United States. In all probability they had been used in speech before they came to be written down: the earliest known uses of them do not suggest that they were conscious new coinages, though they may have been. They were convenient and quite natural terms for describing certain attitudes and projects of social reorganisation for which, by the third decade of the nineteenth century, a broadly identifying label had come to be needed in everyday speech. 
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		It is easy enough to see, in a general way, what those who used these labelling words intended to convey by them. They were formed from the word 'social', and were applied to persons advocating doctrines which were felt to merit the label 'social', and to the doctrines such persons professed. The word 'social' was in this connection contrasted with the word 'individual'. The 'socialists' were those who, in opposition to the prevailing stress on the claims of the individual, emphasised the social element in human relations and sought to bring the social question to the front in the great debate about the rights of man let loose on the world by the French Revolution and by the accompanying revolution in the economic field. Before the word Socialism came into use men had spoken of 'Social Systems', meaning much the same thing. The word 'Socialists' denoted those who advocated one or another of the many 'Social Systems' that were at once contending one with another and united in hostility to the prevailing individualist order in economics, and to the pre-eminence accorded to political over social and economic questions in contemporary views and attitudes about human relations and the right ordering of public affairs. 
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		The groups thus originally dubbed 'socialist' were principally three, though there were many lesser groups representing broadly similar tendencies. These three were, in France, the Saint-Simonians and the Fourierists, and in Great Britain the Owenites, who, in 1841, officially adopted the name of Socialists. Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Robert Owen had in common, despite their many differences, an essentially social approach. This was true in at least three different, though related, senses. In the first place, all three regarded the 'social question' as by far the most important of all, and insisted that it was, above all else, the task of good men to promote the general happiness and well-being. Secondly, all three regarded this task as wholly incompatible with the continuance of any social order which rested on, or set out to encourage, a competitive struggle between man and man for the means of living. Thirdly, all three were deeply distrustful of 'politics' and of politicians, and believed that the future control of social affairs should lie mainly, not with parliaments or ministers, but with 'the producers', and that, if the economic and social sides of men's affairs could be properly organised, the traditional forms of government and political organisation would soon be superseded, and a new world of international peace and collaboration would replace the old world of dynastic and imperialist conflicts. This distrust of 'politics' and this belif that the 'political' order was destined soon to be replaced by a new and better management of men's affairs were of course shared by many thinkers of the early nineteenth century who were not Socialists in any precise sense - for example, Victor Hugo. The contrast between the 'political' and the 'social' attitude to the problems of mankind runs through much of the thought of the period after the Napoleonic Wars.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		Within this common agreement there were wide diversities. The Fourierists and the Owenites were community-makers; they set out to supersede the old societies by covering the earth with a network of local communities founded on a truly social basis, and believed that these new foundations could, without violence or revolution, supersede the existing structures by the sheer effect of their evident superiority in terms of the promotion of human welfare. The Saint-Simonians, on the other hand, were strong believers in the virtues of large-scale organisation and scientific planning, and aimed at transforming national States into great productive corporations dominated by the men of science and high technical capacity, and at linking these regenerated States together by means of master-plans of world-wide economic and social development. The Owenites and the Fourierists for the most part eschewed political activity, in the ordinary sense of the term; whereas the Saint-Simonians were bent on capturing States and Governments and on transforming them to suit their new purposes.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		Again, whereas Fourier's disciples thought mainly in terms of intensive cultivation of the land and relegated industry and commerce to quite minor positions, the Owenites were well aware of the significance of the Industrial Revolution and thought in terms of a new society resting on a balance of agricultural and industrial production; while the Saint-Simonians' attention was given mainly to great engineering feats - canal-cutting, irrigation, road- and rail-way building - and to the organisation of banking and finance as the instruments of large-scale economic planning.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		These were big differences; but the common element in the three doctrines was, none the less, enough to endow them, in popular parlance, with a common name. They were all enemies of individualism, of the competitive economic system, and of the idea of a natural economic law which would work out for the general good if only the politicians would, while enforcing the rights of property, keep their hands off the further regulation of economic affairs. They all stood, against <i>laissez-faire</i>, for the view that economic and social affairs needed collective organisation of a positive kind for the promotion of welfare, and that this organisation should rest, in some sort, on a co-operative, and not on a competitive, principle. In 1839, the economist, J√©r√¥me Blanqui, in his pioneer <i>History of Political Economy</i>, characterised them all as 'Utopian Socialists' - a name which was to become lastingly attached to them through its adoption by Marx and Engels in the <i>Communist Manifesto.</i> 
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		Thus, Socialism, as the word was first used, meant collective regulation of men's affairs on a co-operative basis, with the happiness and welfare of all as the end in view, and with the emphasis not on 'politics' but on the production and distribution of wealth and on the strengthening of 'socialising' influences in the lifelong education of the citizens in co-operative, as against competitive, patterns of behaviour and social attitudes and beliefs. It follows that all the 'Socialists' were deeply interested in education, and regarded a good social education as a fundamental 'right of man'.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		It will be observed that in this description of the common characteristics of early 'Socialist' doctrine there is not a word about the proletariat or the class-struggle between it and the capitalist or employing class. There is nothing about these concepts because, save quite incidentally, they found hardly any place among the ideas of these Socialist schools, though they had, of course, been prominent in Babeuf's movement and were soon to become so again in the social struggles of the 1830s and 1840s. Neither Saint-Simon nor Fourier nor Robert Owen thought at all in terms of a class-struggle between capitalists and workers as rival economic classes, or envisaged the putting of their schemes into effect as involving a grand contest between the proletariat and the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. They all agreed that, as things were, the workers were victims of exploitation; they all stood forth as advocates of the claims of what Saint-Simon termed <i>'la classe la plus nombreuse et la plus pauvre'</i>; they all attacked the undue inequality of property and income and demanded the regulation and limitation of property rights. But they thought of the abuses of the property system as arising rather from the overweening claims of <i>les oisifs</i> - again Saint-Simon's phrase - than from the exploitation of the worker by his direct employer; which latter they regarded as in the main a secondary consequence of the system of oligarchical privilege. Nor must it be forgotten that <i>'la classe la plus nombreuse et la plus pauvre'</i> still consisted, in every country, mainly of peasants and not of industrial workers. Saint-Simon expected <i>les industriels</i>, employers and workers together, to join hands in the struggle against the old privileged classes and the old States which upheld their power. He wished men to be rewarded strictly in accordance with their real services - a doctrine from which his followers drew the logical deduction that inheritance should be done away with. He was quite prepared for <i>les grands industriels</i> to draw large incomes in return for large services to the public. Fourier wished to limit the shares of capital-providers and managers to fixed proportions of the total-product, and also, in effect, to impose a steeply graduated tax on incomes from property; but he did not propose to take away the rights of property or to impose equality of incomes. Owen wanted capital to receive only a fixed or maximum dividend, all surplus profit being devoted to the development of social services for the general benefit; and he also believed that, in course of time, as the institutions of the new society developed, the desire to be richer than others would die out and the capital-owners would voluntarily renounce their share. Neither he nor Fourier, any more than Saint-Simon, conceived their plans as calling for a massed struggle between the employing and the working classes.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		Thus, Fourier sat, day after day and year after year, waiting in vain for responses to his advertisements for capitalists who would be prepared to finance his proposed communities; while Owen threw his own and his friends' money into his 'Villages of Co-operation', and was always looking for rich men capable of understanding the beauty of his ideas. Saint-Simon too dreamed of rich backers' and his successors sometimes found them. Indeed, his best-known disciple, Enfantin, became a railway director, and other Saint-Simonians, such as the Pereire brothers, came to play leading parts in the financial world. Socialism, in its early days and as the term was then understood, was emphatically <i>not</i> a doctrine of class-war between Capital and Labour.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		The class-war doctrine, however, not only existed long before the word 'socialist' came into use, but had its own schools and variations of opinion, which were regarded as distinct from those of 'Socialism'. The principal exponents of the class-war in the 1820s and 1830s were those on the extreme left of Radicalism who looked back for their inspiration to Gracchus Babeuf and the <i>Conspiration des √âgaux</i> of 1796. The words <i>'boubvisme'</i> and <i>babouviste</i> were in frequent use in France, especially after the Revolution of 1830; and the word <i>'prol√©tarien'</i> was particularly associated with the <i>babouviste</i> tradition. The followers of Babeuf, fully as much as the Owenites, the Fourierists, and the Saint-Simonians, gave prominence to <i>'la question sociale'</i>; and they were sometimes lumped in with these groups under the general name of 'Socialists'. But until well after 1830 it was more usual to draw a distinction, the so because, whereas the Saint-Simonians and the Fourierists were organised and recognised groups (as were the Owenites in Great Britain), <i>babouvisme</i> was rather a tendency than a sect, and its exponents were found among the members of democratic and revolutionary clubs and societies which did not collectively profess it as a doctrine, but treated it rather as an outstanding expression of left-wing Jacobinism, and as a first attempt to carry the Revolution of 1789 right through to its logical conclusion.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		'Communism' was another word which ame into use in France during the social ferment that followed the Revolution of 1830. How and when it originated cannot be exactly said; but we hear of it first in connection with some of the secret revolutionary societies of Paris during the 'thirties, and we know that it came into common use in the 1840s mainly as a designation of the theories of √âtienne Cabet. It seems to have carried with it, right from the beginning, something of a <i>double entendre</i>. As used by Frenchmen, it conjured up the idea of the <i>commune</i>, as the basic unit of neighbourhood and self-government, and suggested a form of social organisation resting on a federation of free communes. But at the same time it suggested the notion of <i>communaut√©</i> - of having things in common and of common ownership; and it was in this aspect that it was developed by Cabet and his followers, whereas the other element connected it rather with the underground clubs of the extreme left, and, through them, with the clubs of exiled revolutionaries through which it passed on to be employed in the name of the Communist League of 1847 and of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> of 1848. In Great Britain the word 'communist' seems to have been first used in 1840 - imported from France by the Owenite John Goodwyn Barmby, in his letters from Paris published in <i>The New Moral World.</i> He used it chiefly with reference to the followers of Cabet, who had been much influenced by Owenism. In the 1840s it was often used in connection with 'Socialism', but usually as distinct from it, and as carrying a more militant implication. It was chosen deliberately by the group for which Marx and Engels prepared the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> because it carried with it more than 'Socialist' the idea of revolutionary struggle, and had, at the same time, a clearerconnection with the notion of common ownership and enjoyment. It was, Engels has explained, less 'utopian': it lent itself better to association with the idea of the class-struggle and with the Materialist Conception of History.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		So far, we have been speaking in terms of words and of the ideas and schools of thought and action they were first used to designate. But, of course, many of the ideas had existed long before the schools in question came into being. There was nothing novel in stressing the claims of society as against those of the individual; nothing new in dnouncing social inequalities or in accusing the rich of exploiting the poor; nothing new in asserting the need for an education of all citizens in the principles of social morality; nothing new in proposing community of goods. Assuredly, ther was onthing new in writing social utopias, or in claiming for all men economic as well as civil and political rights. Accordingly it was quite natural that the words which had come into useto denote the Fourierists, the Saint-Simonians, the Owenites, the Icarians (followers of Cabet), and the other sects of the early nineteenth century should be applied before long to earlier thinkers and projectors whose ideas in some measure seemed to resemble theirs. The labels 'socialist', 'communist' (and, later, 'anarchist') came to be used with reference to all manner of past doctrines in which emphasis had been put on living in common, on collective ownership, on education in social morality, or on collective social planning and control of the environment of habits and institutions which shaped men's lives.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		In France, where so much of Socialist theory had its birth, men's thoughts naturally turned back first of all to the immediate precursors of Saint-Simon and of Fourier - to those who, as <i>philosophes</i> of the eiteenth-century Enlightenment, had put forward, often in the form of utopias, the most tenchant criticisms of contemporary society. They found anticipations of Socialism and of Communism in the works of Morelly (<i>Code de la nature,</i> 1755, at one time attributed to Diderot), of the Abb√© Bonnot de Mably (<i>Entetiens de Phocion sur les rapports de la morale avec la politique</i>, 1763, and other works), and earlier still, in the <i>Testament</i> of the Cur√© Meslier (died c. 1730), then known only in an incomplete version edited by Voltaire. They found elements of Socialist doctrine in Rousseau's <i>Discours sur l'origine de l'in√©galit√©</i> (1755), with its passionate denunciations of the evils arising out of private property, and even in the √©tatisme of <i>Du contrat social</i> (1762). They went back to Condorcet's pleas for education as a human right, as well as to his prophetic <i>Esquisse</i> of the progress of the spirit of man.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		These reachings back into the eighteenth century necessarily led them to look much further into the past. Mably had built consciously on Plato's Republic; and he, Rousseau, and many others had harked back to Plutarch's account of the constitution of ancient Sparta. Through these intermediaries the ancestry of Socialism and Communism was traced back to the classical world; while others rediscovered the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, or other peasant uprisings, or harked back to the 'Communism' of the early Christian Church and the communistic elements in the monastic life of the Middle Ages. Yet others traced Socialism back to More's <i>Utopia</i> (1516), Campanella's <i>City of the Sun</i> (1623), and other writings of the Renaissance. In Great Britain, Robert owen had his attention drawn by Francis Place to the late seventeenth-century tract of <i>Colledges of Industry</i>, by the Quaker, John Bellers, in which Owen found an anticipation of some of his own ideas for dealing with the problems of poverty and unemployment; and it was not a far cry from Bellers to Peter Chamberlen, or to the more radical groups among the Puritans of the Civil War and Commonwealth periods - to Levellers and Diggers, though this quest was not much followed till a good deal later.<sup><i>I</i> The Anabaptists of M√ºnster, also, were called into requisition, by both foes and friends, to contribute to the pedigree of Socialist and Communist doctrines.</sup>

		In this volume I do not propose to retell the story of these anticipations, real or fancied, of the Socialist and Communist movements of the nineteenth century. I put them aside, not as unimportant, but as falling outside the subject on which I am at present setting out to write. I propose, however, to go back to a date some forty years before the names 'Socialism' and 'socialist' came into common use, because the history of the movements of the period after the Napoleonic Wars cannot be understood at all except against the background of the great French Revolution and of the political, economic, and social changes which the Revolution let loose. It is now a commonplace to say that from 1789 onwards Europe was in the throes of three kinds of revolutionary change - <i>political and social</i>, symbolised by the events in France and their repercussions in other countries, <i>industrial</i>, marked by the advent of steam power and the extended application of scientific techniques in manufacture and in civil and mechanical engineering, and <i>agrarian</i>, involving vast changes in methods of land-cultivation and stock-breeding, and in the character of rural life. These three linked revolutions did not, of course, all being in 1789. The industrial and agrarian revolutions cannot be pinned down to a single year or event: the steam-engine, as Watt left it, was the outcome of a long chain of inventions and improvements, and the new husbandry developed gradually, with no one outstanding event to mark its onset. Only the political Revolution can be assigned to a particular year in which it began; and its soical content was being prepared long before the Fall of the Bastille proclaimed to the world the ending of the <i>ancien r√©gime</i>.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		1789, then, is not, and cannot be, an exact starting-point; but it will in general serve my purpose well enough because I am concerned in this book primarily with ideas and only secondarily with events and movements. In the realm of ideas, 1789 is the dividing line, because men filt it to be so, and shaped their ideas and projects thereafter in a different frame of mind, as adventurers faring forth into a new world in the making.

	<p class="JustifyParagraph">
		Although Socialism, in one sense, began long before, and in another sense some decades after, the great French Revolution, there is, we have seen, a good enough reason for taking 1789 as a starting-point for a study of the development of modern Socialist ideas. This is the point from which it is possible to trace, not only a continuous development in the field of thought, but also a growing connection between the thought and movements seeking to give practical expression to it. The socialistic or communistic theorists of the eighteenth century had no movements behind them, even in the realm of theory: they were almost isolated thinkers standing on the periphery of a vast intellectual movement which had in it a large democratic and liberal content, but nothing specifically socialist in its essential ideas - at any rate, nothing more than a belief in human happiness as an objective of social policy and in human perfectibility as a possible goal to be reached by the continued progress of <i>les lumi√®res.</i> The eiteenth-century 'Socialists' were, first and foremost, moralists and moral reformers. They denounced with strong humanitarian fervour the co-existence of riches and poverty, of luxury and sheer indigence, and they traced the sources of these evils and of the depravity that went with them to bad political and social institutions. Men were depraved, they held, not because of natural wickedness, but because they lived in a bad environment which encouraged luxury, pride, and oppression and condemned the many to exist under degrading conditions of servitude and want. These social critics were by no means necessarily revolutionaries or rebels: some of them made only modest practical proposals for change, and most of them put their hopes much more on education and the growth of reasonableness than on any uprising of the oppressed. They tended either to write 'Utopias' or to construct models of a perfect society and rules for its conduct; but the eighteenth-century utopias were not so much practical projects of social reorganisation as pleasant dreams conveying lessons in moral attitudes and behaviour. There was initially no connection between these visions of a new society and any popular movement - much less any proletarian movement - for bringing it into existence. The very notion of the proletariat as a revolutionary force goes back no further than Babeuf. The 'social' doctrines which prepared the way for the socialist movements of the nineteenth century were predominantly ethical expositions of human relations as they were not, but ought to be. 
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		But during the years which immediately followed the taking of the Bastille and the <i>D√©claration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen</i>, the 'social question' forced its way for the first time to the front, not merely as a moral problem for a limited group of intellectuals and reformers of manners, but as an insistent practical issue revolving a real and menacing conflict between the rich and the poor - between the propertied and the propertyless - as well as between the privileged orders of the old society and the unprivileged <i>Tiers √âtat</i>.The first clear sign of this came from the countryside rather than from the towns: it was the burning of title-deeds, the sack of ch√¢teaux, and the flight of many of the feudal nobility and of their agents. But the towns also showed indications of the coming struggle in the demands embodieds in the <i>cahiers</i> from working-class areas and in the growth of clubs and societies with a predominantly working-class, or at any rate an artisan, following. Of these two manifestations, that of the peasants was of course much the larger, and the more significant immediately; and it was also much the more successful, for, broadly speaking, the peasants got what they most wanted - land and freedom from feudal exactions. The urban artisans did not: the Revolution had nothing to offer them in the way of immediate economic advantages. They became citizens, but not property-owners; and even their rights of citizenship were soon a matter of acrimonious debate between the rival factions which were contending over the new Constitution of the French Republic. In 1793 they seemed, for a moment, certain at any rate of political rights; but the democratic Constitution of that year was never allowed to come into force. The urban poor saw themselves cheated of the fruits of the Revolution, denied the anticipated recognition of their rights as 'men and citizens'. A section among them reacted by adhering to the leaders who promised them the vindication of these rights, and began to link the demand for political equality to the demand for work and for bread on behalf of the many workers who had been thrown out of employment by the conomic dislocations accompanying the Revolution. 
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		In effect, the events of the period between 1789 and the defeat of the Conspiracy of the Equals led by Gracchus Babeuf a few years later made the class-struggle for the first time, albeit on a small scale and only for a moment, an open reality in a modern society, and in the course of the battle between rich and poor led to a formulation of socialistic doctrines which, never commanding more than a small number of direct followers, nevertheless represented a new element in the historical development of Western society.  
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		In order to appreciate the character of htese conflicts, in which activist movements anticipatory of modern Socialism first took shape, it is necessary to say something of the meaning of the great French Revolution as a social force - that is, in more than its purely political implications. It has often been said that the leaders of the Revolution - moderates, Girondins and Jacobins alike - proclaimed themselves firm upholders of the rights of property as well as of civil and political liberty, and that nothing was further from their thoughts than to challenge private property and set about putting in its place any sort of common ownership of the means of production. This is true enough if we except the small group which presently gathered round Gracchus Babeuf. The Jacobins, fully as much as the parties to the right of them, believed in the necessity of individual property, and, indeed, in the need for its diffusion over a much larger section of the people. They stood for the break-up of the great estates as well as for the abolition of feudal exaction and the alienation of the great privileges and property rights that had become vested in the Church; but they aimed at diffusing property rather than at destroying it, and the attacks which they made upon established property rights were justified by them either on the ground that the forms of property which they were attacking were anti-social and indefensible invasions of the rights of man, or, presently, after the outbreak of the revolutionary wars, on the ground that the necessities of public safety must, for the time being, override all other considerations. In abolishing the feudal rights of the nobility and in placing the property of the Church at the disposition of the new State, the leaders of the Revolution drew a sharp distinction between the 'wrongs of property' which they were attacking and those rights of property which they were concerned to defend and to render more sacred by striking away the undergrowth of indefensible claims that had grown up around them. Feudal dues seemed to them not forms of legitimate property but intolerable interferences with the legitimate rights of property, which belonged, or should belong, to the mass of the rural population. They felt themselves to be, not attacking property, but liberating peasant property in abolishing these dues, and, at the same time, to be liberating the property of all the productive classes from exactions levied upon it by an unproductive nobility and a parasitic court. Similarly, in the case of the Church, they felt that the property which the Church had accumulated to itself, as well as its claims to dues from the rest of the people, stood for an illegitimate exaction rather than for any indefeasible right. Brought up in the tradition of the <i>ancien r√©gime</i>, they inherited its doctrine of political absolutism of the State over the Church, and, in this, they were reinforced by the Erastianism of the social doctrine proclaimed in Rousseau's <i>Social Contract</i> - and, indeed, in most of the writings of the eighteenth-century enlightenment. They felt that, in attacking the feudal claims of the nobility and the exactions of the Church, they were moving with the current of national opinion. This, indeed, advanced in the momentum of the Revolution well ahead of the legislative enactments, which, to a large extent, merely sanctioned what had been already achieved by the direct action of the people.
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		In the early years of the Revolution the new leaders of the people made no attack on the property of the rich except where it took the form of feudal claims or of ecclesiastical exploitation. Many of them had, indeed, a deep belief in the evil consequences of excessive economic inequality - an attitude inherited from the political philosophers from F√©nelon onwards, and preached in season and out of season throughout the eighteenth century as a moral doctrine. The eighteenth-century philosophers who can be regarded as significant forerunners of Socialist doctrine - such as Mably and, in a different sense, Rousseau - had never wearied of denouncing the evils of luxury, or of proclaiming the virtues of the life of simple sufficiency; and the leaders of the Revolution were deeply imbued with the moral fervour of these intellectual reformers. Nevertheless, they did not attack the rich, as such, until they were positively driven to do so by the necessities of the time - first, by the prevailing scarcity which compelled them to fix prices of necessaries and to proscribe hoarding, forestalling, and other monopolistic exactions in order to prevent sheer famine, and, before long, by the added necessities of war, which compelled the French State to meet its rapidly mountin expenses by laying hold of every bit of surplus property or income which seemed capable of being made available for meeting the immediate necessities of the nation. In all this, the leaders of the new r√©gime were no more than inheritors of the traditions of the old, for the <i>ancien r√©gime</i>, equally with them, had proclaimed the doctrine that the State had a full right, in case of necessity, to lay hands on the property of individuals where it was needed for the salvation of the kingdom. The leaders of the French Revolution inherited the conceptions of universal sovereignty that had been dominant under the <i>ancien r√©gime</i>. They simply transferred these conceptions to the new society resting on a foundation of popular sovereignty. But attacks on the rights of property in the interests of public safety had been, and continued to be, thought of as exceptional and as based on the temporary necessities of a nation at war or beset by famine. There was nothing in them, consciously at any rate, of an attack on the fundamental rights to property, certainly nothing of a desire immediately to substitute a r√©gime of common ownership for the system of individual property rights which the old conditions were felt to have thwarted instead of furthered. Above all, the Revolution was engaged in spreading the rights of property among the peasants, in purging them from illegitimate feudal accretions, and in freeing urban trades and industries from the bureaucratic trammels and exactions of the corporative system. It was fighting for the 'true', the 'natural' right of property against the false and 'unnatural' system of privilege and monopoly; and its leaders, or most of them, conceived of this battle as being waged in the common interest of the unprivileged - property-owners, new and old, and artisans and workers together. 
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		No doubt, quite a number of the more advanced leaders of the Revolution had imbibed notions of utopian Communism from the eighteenth-century philosophers - above all from Mably and Morelly - and had drunk deep of the doctrine of Rousseau's <i>Discourse on the Origin of Inequality</i>, with its tracing of the evils of civilisation to the inordinate development of property rights in the more advanced types of cvilised society. Even, however, if some of these leaders speculated in terms of communistic utopias based on the fullest social equality, few of them incorporated their dreams into the practical policies which they urged the Revolutionary Assemblies to adopt. For example, Jean-Pierre Brissot - the Girondin leader - has sometimes been regarded as a Socialist forerunner, but nothing was further from his thoughts than to espouse any sort of Communism or communal ownership as a basis for the immediate reconstruction of French society. Indeed, many of those who had been most influenced by utopian theories of Communism √† la Mably and were most prone in their speeches to extol the virtues of Lycurgus and of ancient Sparta were, in respect of social policies, among the most moderate in their immediate claims. 
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph">
		Broadly speaking, it is fair to say that the main body of the leaders of the French Revolution, including the Jacobin leaders no less than the more moderate groups, envisaged the task of the Revolution as the diffusion of property rights in such a way as to diminish the more glaring social inequalities and to abolish the ancient forms of privilege and hoped, in doing these things, to liberate economic forces which, under a r√©gime of unprivileged competition, would, in accordance with the doctrines of the <i>√©conomistes</i>, make for maximum production of wealth and, therewith, for the greatest well-being of the greatest number. This did not prevent the Jacobins, in particular, from denouncing continually the evils of inequality and the exactions of the rich or from demanding drastic reforms in the system of taxation so as to relieve the poor from all their burdens and to place the entire cost of the State upon the surplus incomes and property of the rich.  But these denunciations represented in part a reaction to the actual anti-social behaviour of the rich under stress of the Revolution and to the prevalence of counter-revolutionary forces among the property-owning classes, and, in part, a desire for greater social equality, which was felt to depend on the diffusion of property rather than to involve any attack on fundamental property rights. 
	</p> <p class="JustifyParagraph"> 
		It was the stress of war, excess of suffering, and the defeat and decapitation of the Jacobin Party that lay behind the emergence of the communistic conspiracy of Babeuf and his group. There had been before Babeuf a few voices crying in the wilderness for an immediate application of the principles of community and common ownership. Chappuis, in particular, had presented to the Constituent Assembly projects which anticipated no small part of Fourier's social doctrine, including a plan for collective communities, which were to be very like Fourier's <i>phalanst√©res</i>; but Chappuis and the few others who produced similar ideas remained unknown except to a very few, and their schemes had no influence at all on the course of events. It was left for Babeuf and his group to put forward, on the morrow of the eclipse of the Jacobin Party and of the sharp reaction against the <i>√©lan</i> of the Revolution which took place under the Directory, an almost fully fledged scheme of proletarian Communism, in which can be traced the forerunner not only of later Socialist doctrines of common ownership and exploitation of the means of production, but also of the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat as a means of subjugating the other classes and of defeating the endeavours of the counterrevolution.
