<title>Socialist Thought: The Forerunners 1789-1850</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Explanation: What is this website?</h2>
  <p>The following is an attempt, by an admitted amateur (hereafter named 'Hositrugun'), at creating an HTML markup of an important text, by G.D.H. Cole, on the history of Socialist ideology, and philosopy. The work is out of print, difficult to find in any but the most well-stocked of libraries, and heretorefore, no digital version of it has ever been made; this is an attempt to rectify that. I apologise in advance for any issues in formatting, or readability of the text. I must reiterate that this is my first real attempt at building any kind of website. <br> If you have any suggestions, then you may contact me at <br> The actual book can be found <a href="https://hositrugun.github.io/WebsiteBookSocialismAttempt/SocialistThoughtVolumeI.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Alterations Made</h3>
The following alterations, though by no means major changes, are nonetheless recorded here for the purposes of full disclosure:<br>
1. In the original book, the preface is placed before the Table of Contents. Here the order is reversed, so that the Table of Contents comes before everything else, as this is more suited to a website format. <br>
2. In several places, in the original book, such as headings, and in the Table of Contents, the text is written in All-Caps, with the letters which would normally be distinguished by capitalisation being rendered in a larger font instead. This is needlessly difficult to do in HTML, and so here is replaced with a more standard capital vs. lowercase formatting. 

<h3>Shit to add, (besides more of the book's text)</h3>
1. Distinct 'light mode', and 'dark mode' settings. 
<br>2. Separate pages for each of the book's chapters, and a table of contents, in addition to the 'whole text in one page' set up, which I have currently.
<h3>Questions to ask:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>How do I organise text into a table?
    <li>How do I right-align, left-align, centre-align, and justified-align text? 
    <li>How do I change the colour of the background, as opposed to the colour of the text? I found a tutorial online, and the shit did not work.
