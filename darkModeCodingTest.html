<title>Socialist Thought: The Forerunners 1789-1850</title>

<h2>Explanation: What is this website?</h2>
  <p>The following is an attempt, by an admitted amateur (hereafter named 'Hositrugun'), at creating an HTML markup of an important text, by G.D.H. Cole, on the history of Socialist ideology, and philosopy. The work is out of print, difficult to find in any but the most well-stocked of libraries, and heretorefore, no digital version of it has ever been made; this is an attempt to rectify that. I apologise in advance for any issues in formatting, or readability of the text. I must reiterate that this is my first real attempt at building any kind of website. If you have any suggestions, then you may contact me at </p>

<h3>Alterations Made</h3>
The following alterations, though by no means major changes, are nonetheless recorded here for the purposes of full disclosure:<br>
1. In the original book, the preface is placed before the Table of Contents. Here the order is reversed, so that the Table of Contents comes before everything else, as this is more suited to a website format. <br>
2. In several places, in the original book, such as headings, and in the Table of Contents, the text is written in All-Caps, with the letters which would normally be distinguished by capitalisation being rendered in a larger font instead. This is needlessly difficult to do in HTML, and so here is replaced with a more standard capital vs. lowercase formatting. 

<h3>Shit to add, (besides more of the book's text)</h3>
1. Distinct 'light mode', and 'dark mode' settings. 
<br>2. Separate pages for each of the book's chapters, and a table of contents, in addition to the 'whole text in one page' set up, which I have currently.
<h3>Questions to ask:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>How do I organise text into a table?
    <li>How do I right-align, left-align, centre-align, and justified-align text? 
    <li>How do I change the colour of the background, as opposed to the colour of the text? I found a tutorial online, and the shit did not work.

  <p>This book, althought it stands by itself, is designed to be the first of a series forming together a general history of Socialist thought. It covers, roughly, the years from 1789 to the middle of the nineteenth century; but even within the limits of space which I have set myself, it obviously leaves out some things which belong to that period. The biggest of these omissions is that of Russian Socialism - from Pestel's projects of land nationalisation in the 1820s to Belinsky, Herzen, and Bakunin, who were all active well before 1850. This omission is deliberate, and will be made good in the second volume. I found it more convenient to postpone discussion of Herzen and Bakunin with the struggles which split the First International and with the development of Anarchism. As against these omissions, I have carried the story of a number of thinkers with whom I have dealt in the present volume a long way beyond 1850. Blanqui and Proudhon are outstanding instances. In the case of Marx and Engels, on the other hand, I have tried to deal only with the earlier phases, leaving the later development of their thought to be discussed in connection with the movements which they created or influenced in the second half of the century. Thus, no full exposition of Marxism is attempted in this volume, which stops short, not quite at the <i>Communism Manifesto</i>,  but at the dissolution of the Communis League after the eclipse of the European revolutionary movement at the beinning of the 1850s.</p>
  <p>I wish to make it clear that this book is not meant to be a history of a Socialism, but only of Socialist <i>thought</i> with such references to actual movements as are necessary to explain the thought. Indeed, the writing of a comprehensive history of Socialism would be an impossible task for any single author, and would have to be on a much bigger scale than anything I have in mind to write - or should have, even if I possessed the requisite knowledge. Even within the more modest limits of what I am attempting I am very conscious of my short-comings. I have no Russian, almost no Spanish, very little Italian, and not much German; and I hate reading German, and avoid it whenever I can. I tend therefore to use English or French translations of works in these languages where they exist, and to refer to German originals of translated works only when I want to be sure a passage has not been wrongly rendered. I also tend to take my German material much more at second hand, where translations do not exist, than either English or French writings; and I expect my more expert readers will easily discover this for themselves, though I hope I have not allowed myself to be led badly astray.</p>
  <p>The second volume of this work is already half in draft. Besides picking up the omitted Russian pioneers, it deals mainly with the later phases of Marxism up to the rise of the various Social Democratic Parties in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, with the First International, the Paris Commune, and the split between Marxists, Anarchists, and those, such as the British Fabians and Independent Labourites, who were neither, and also with the continenetal developments of Christian Social doctrine after 1850 and with the peculiarly German movement often called 'Academic Socialism', or 'Socialism of the Chair'. I mention these facts because they help to explain the omission from the present volume of a number of non-Russian Socialists who had begun to be active well before 1850 - for example, Rodbertus, Lassalle, and von Kettler in Germany, Colins, Kats, and de Kayser in Belgium, and some of the Italian and Spanish pioneers.</p>
  <p>In connection with the present volume, I have a number of obligations to acknowledge. The greatest of all is to my colleage, Isaiah Berlin, who has read the whole book in proof and has helped me to improve it greatly in accordance with his admirably sagacious criticisms. I also owe valuable suggestions to my colleagues, Dr. H.G. Schenk and John Plamenatz, who read a number of chapters and put me right in not a few places where I had gone wrong. I am also most grateful to my brother-in-law, Raymond Postgate, and to my friend, H.L. Beales, for the loan of books which I should have not found it easy to obtain elsewhere; and, as always, I owe a great deal to the untiring help of my secretary, Rosamund Broadley, who, by a miracle, can read my writing and forgive me for it. <br> My wife I am in debt to so often that I usually end by not thanking her at all.<br> G.D.H.

  <p>The impossibility of defining Socialism has often been emphasised, and sometimes regarded as a reproach. But neither in Politics nor in Morals is any important idea or system ever capable of being exactly defined. Who can satisfactorily define democracy, or liberty, or virtue, or happiness, or the State, or for that matter, individualism any more than Socialism? The most that can be attempted in such cases as these, with any prospect of success, is the discovery of some central core of meaning, present with varying additions in all or most of the manifold uses of the words in question, but in all probability never found alone, without any addition. The discovery of this central core will not enable us to understand these words; for the added significances form no less essential parts of their acquired meanings. A word means what it is used to mean, or, for practical purposes, at what it is commonly used to mean, or has been commonly used to mean by persons to whose utterances we need to pay any attention. Nevertheless, if we can find a central core of meaning, we are better placed for understanding the varieties of usage; and in the search for this core it is a valuable first step to find out how a word first came into use. </p>
  <p>It is not known who first used the words 'Socialism' and 'socialist'. So far as is known, they first appeared in print in Italian in 1803, but in a sense entirely unconnected with any of their later meanings. Thereafter there has, so far, been found no trace of them until 1827, when the word 'socialist' was used in the owenite <i>Co-operative Magazine</i> to designate the followers of Owen's Co-operative doctrines. The word '<i>socialisme</i>' made its first known appearance in print in a French periodical - <i>Le Globe</i> - in 1832. This paper was then edited by Pierre Leroux, who had made it the principal organ of the Saint-Simonians; and the word '<i>socialisme</i>' was used as a characterisation of the Saint-Simonian doctrine. The word was freely used by Leroux and Reynaud during the 1830s in their <i>Nouvelle Encyclop√©die</i> and in other writings, and soon came to be employed in a wider sense to include a number of groups aiming at some kind of new social order resting on an economic and social conception of human rights. Thereafter, both 'Socialism', and 'socialist' were used quite frequently both in France and in Great Britain; and they soon spread to Germany and to other European countries and also to the United States. In all probability they had been used in speech before they came to be written down: the earliest known uses of them do not suggest that they were conscious new coinages, though they may have been. They were convenient and quite natural terms for describing certain attitudes and projects of social reorganisation for which, by the third decade of the nineteenth century, a broadly identifying label had come to be needed in everyday speech. </p>
  <p>It is easy enough to see, in a general way, what those who used these labelling words intended to convey by them. They were formed from the word 'social', and were applied to persons advocating doctrines which were felt to merit the label 'social', and to the doctrines such persons professed. The word 'social' was in this connection contrasted with the word 'individual'. The 'socialists' were those who, in opposition to the prevailing stress on the claims of the individual, emphasised the social element in human relations and sought to bring the social question to the front in the great debate about the rights of man let loose on the world by the French Revolution and by the accompanying revolution in the economic field. Before the word Socialism came into use men had spoken of 'Social Systems', meaning much the same thing. The word 'Socialists' denoted those who advocated one or another of the many 'Social Systems' that were at once contending one with another and united in hostility to the prevailing individualist order in economics, and to the pre-eminence accorded to political over social and economic questions in contemporary views and attitudes about human relations and the right ordering of public affairs. </p>
